# we-split-ios
WeSplit is a tiny SwiftUI app that calculates each person’s share of a check, including tip. Built during my TPM learning journey, with instructions from Paul Hudson’s 100 Days of SwiftUI. Enter amount, choose people (2–99), pick tip, and see per-person total update instantly. Tech: SwiftUI, Xcode 16. MIT.
